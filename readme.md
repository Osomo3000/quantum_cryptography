## repository structure

Here's a quick breakdown of what to find where in the repository:

* [Theory](markdown/theory.md) üí≠ describes the the BB84 algorithm and required theory
* [Hardware](markdown/hardware.md) üî≠ collects information about which hardware was used and how to set it up
* [3D models](3d-models) üèóÔ∏è holds printable components
* [Setup](markdown/setup.md) üßëüèª‚Äçüíª installation instructions for the software and required services
* [Notebooks](notebooks) ü™ê contains the actual JupyterLab Notebooks for Alice, Bob and Eve
* [Guidelines](markdown/guidelines.md) ‚úíÔ∏è  coding and contribution guidelines

## frequently asked questions

**Why build some components instead of using the respective ThorLabs versions?**

Mainly to keep it open-source and reduce the size of the hardware setup. As an added bonus it lowers the cost and barrier of entry for anyone who is interested in replicating the project.

**What hardware do I need to run this project?**

See [Hardware](markdown/hardware.md) for a list of required components and [3D models](3d-models) for printable parts.
