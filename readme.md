# quantum key distribution

Basic order of events:

1. generating a one time pad between Alice and Bob
2. then checking if anybody was eavesdropping

---

* after sharing the key a test if performed:
  * if anybody was listening the key is discarded
  * if not they have a new key to communicate with
* the reason why this works is because **any measurement on a quantum object leaves a trace**
  * it is impossible to read information traveling over a quantom channel without perturbing it

## BB84 protocol

* this scheme can use any quantum object with a two value observeable
* in practice the quantum object is the **polarization of a photon**

---

Alice has a source to generate photons with four possible polarizations:

1. **H**, horizontal
2. **V**, vertical
3. **L**, left
4. **R**, right

H and R are along the X and Y axis. L and R 45 degrees rotated from that.
